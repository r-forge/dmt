* test.stats.R 

is used to produce test statistics for dmt package;


* test.stats.txt

test statistics; correlations between true model parameters and
estimates given by dmt.

============================================

DESCRIPTION OF COMPLETED TEST CASES

The tests are run with the different covariance structures and 
latent variable dimensionalities.


tests/ppca.R # probabilistic PCA (1 and 2 data sets)
tests/pfa.R  # probabilistic factor analysis (1 and 2 data sets)
tests/pcca.R # probabilistic CCA (2 data sets)

tests/depmod.R        # prob. CCA
tests/depmod.simcca.R # prob. SimCCA (Wx = Wy)

tests/pcca.nnW.R    # prob. CCA with non-negative W
tests/psimcca.nnW.R # prob. SimCCA (Wx = Wy) with non-negative W

tests/drcca.R  # drCCA functions

OK regularization: yes -> W >=0 (alpha/beta?)
OK regularization: no
OK matched: yes
OK matched: no

==============================================

TODO TESTS

- currently measuring correlation, add accuracy measures
- soft regularization on W (tuning priors$Nm.wx.wy.sigma)
- pcca.with.isotropic.margins
- speedup tests

==============================================

TODO FEATURES

- Sparsity regularization for W and/or z (Gaussian / elastic net / IBP / ...)
- T priors when dx != dy
- Wy fixed, only optimize Wx (regression-type models)
