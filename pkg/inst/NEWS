CHANGES IN VERSION 0.8.09 (2012-05-25)

  o added treatment of one-dimensional data in pfa

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.8.08 (2012-05-24)

BUG FIXES

  o changed argument log -> logarithm in determinant function

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.8.07 (2011-10-14)

  o removed compiler and methods from dependencies
  o packageStartupMessage in firstlib.R


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.8.06 (2011-07-27)

  o added compiler package to dependencies
  o option for exponential prior on W added in pfa

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.8.05 (2011-07-15)

  o optimize.parameters.R sometimes got stuck due to very mild
  convergence criterion bug. Now corrected.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.8.04 (2011-07-11)

  o added pfa.log.likelihood

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.8.03 (2011-04-13)

  o plotVar fixed (screen removed)

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.8.01 (2011-03-28)

  o bug with matched = TRUE, Nm.Wx.Wy.sigma = 0, with diagonal
    covariances and identical isotropic covariances; in W.simcca.EM
    function the W$total name was missing, causing failure. Corrected.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.7.07 (2011-02-25)

  o package was accepted to CRAN and passed all tests; added links to
    vignette and website
  o tests/ directory removed, too time-consuming.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.7.04 (2011-02-21)

  o covLimit parameter name was changed into epsilon

  o convergence is now checked across multiple consecutive steps to
    improve stability of the results: the par.change option was
    removed, and convergence.steps option added in
    fit.dependency.model/optimize.parameters

  o added intercept calculation in check.data.R

BUG FIXES

  o marginalCovariances definition was missing in some
    optimize.parameters calls in fit.dependency.model.R; corrected.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.7.01 (2011-02-13)

  o updated vignette and man pages. ready for initial submission to
    CRAN.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.4.20 (2011-02-13)

  o added tests/depmod.simcca.R for case Wx = Wy; W free
    still some unoptimal convergence with full covariances

CHANGES IN VERSIOn 0.4.19 (2011-02-13)

  o added tests/depmod.R for case Wx != Wy; W free
    still some unoptimal convergence with full covariances

CHANGES IN VERSIOn 0.4.18 (2011-02-13)

  o added marginalCovariances isotropic, identical isotropic, diagonal
    in fit.dependency.model and tests/psimcca.nnW.R. Still needs
    simple speedups and more robustness but tests are ok.

CHANGES IN VERSIOn 0.4.17 (2011-02-13)

  o added tests/pcca.nnW.R for case Wx != Wy; W>=0

CHANGES IN VERSIOn 0.4.15 (2011-02-12)

  o added tests/psimcca.nnW.R for case Wx = Wy; W>=0
  o tidied up the code; combined some files in R directory
  o added toy data generation function generate.toydata

CHANGES IN VERSIOn 0.4.09 (2011-02-02)

 o in calculate.ppca removed X field from W output in Y = NULL i.e.
   one data case (now only W$total available)

CHANGES IN VERSIOn 0.4.08 (2011-01-25)

  o The latent variable is calculated as dependency model
    is calculated. getZ method is used to retrieve the 
    latent variable

  o All a priori information is given as priors argument to
    fit.dependency.model. H is changed to priors$Nm.wxwy.mean
    and sigmas to priors$Nm.wxwy.sigma. 

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.4.07 (2011-01-17)

  o W.effects and z.effects removed from the package
