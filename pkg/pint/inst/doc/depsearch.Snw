\section{Introduction}

%* motivation

Paired genomic observations of related biological aspects in the same
patients are increasingly available, including measurements of gene-
and miRNA expression, gene copy number, and methylation status.  Study
of the dependencies can reveal functional mechanisms and interactions
not seen in the individual data sets. For example, integration of gene
expression and copy number has been shown to reveal cancer-associated
chromosomal regions and associated genes with potential diagnostic,
prognostic and clinical impact \cite{Lahti09mlsp}.

% * canonical correlations, probabilistic models

The {\it pint} package provides tools for the discovery and analysis
of statistical dependencies between co-occurring data sources. The
currently implemented methods are based on the probabilistic canonical
correlation analysis (pCCA) framework \cite{Bach05} and its extensions
\cite{Archambeau06,Klami08,Lahti09mlsp}. The package provides tools to
guide dependency modeling through Bayesian priors
\cite{Lahti09mlsp}. The models assume approximately Gaussian
distributed observations. Probabilistic formulation deals rigorously
with uncertainty associated with small sample sizes common in
biomedical studies.

%* application

We demonstrate how to integrate gene or micro-RNA expression with DNA
copy number (aCGH) measurements to discover functionally active
mutations. The models capture the strongest shared signal in paired
observations, and indicates affected genes and patients. The
dependency modeling framework is potentially applicable also to other
types of biomedical data, including methylation, SNPs, alternative
splicing and transcription factor binding, or in other application
fields.

\section{Examples}

\subsection{Example data}

Use of the package is demonstrated with an example data set containing
paired observations of gene expression and copy number from a set of
gastric cancer patients \cite{Myllykangas08}.

Load the package and example data:

<<>>=
require(pint)
data(chromosome17)
@

Each example data set ($geneExp$ and $geneCopyNum$) consists of a list
with two items: $data$ and $info$. The probes in gene expression and
gene copy number are assumed to be paired. $data$ is a data matrix
with gene expression or gene copy number data. Genes are in rows and
samples in columns and rows and columns should be named. $info$ is a
data frame with additional information about genes. It has three
elements: $loc$, $chr$ and $arm$. $loc$ indicates the genomic location
of the probes in base pairs (numeric); $chr$ and $arm$ are factors
indicating the chromosome and chromosomal arm of the probe.

\subsection{Discovering functionally active copy number changes}

Screen the genome to discover chromosomal regions with statistical
dependencies between the measurements (gene expression and copy number
in our example). 

<<>>=
model17qpSimCCA <- screen.chromosome(geneExp, geneCopyNum, 
                             	     windowSize = 10, 
                                     chr = 17, arm = 'q', 
                                     method = "pSimCCA") 
@

This example uses the default method (pSimCCA; \cite{Lahti09mlsp}) to
screen over chromosome arm 17q for dependencies. The dependency is
measured within a chromosomal region ('window') around each gene,
defined with a fixed window size of 10 closest genes. A fixed window
size quarantees the comparability of the dependency scores between
windows.

\subsection{Visualizing the results}

Chromosomal regions with the strongest dependencies can be seen from a
dependency plot:

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
<<fig = true>>=
plot(model17qpSimCCA, showTop = 10)
@
\end{center}
\caption{The dependency plot reveals chromosomal regions with high
  dependency between gene expression and copy number.}
\label{fig:pSimCCA}
\end{figure}

The highest dependency is in the area between 30Mbp and 40Mbp. This is
a known gastric cancer associated region (see
e.g. \cite{Lahti09mlsp}). The top-5 genes with the highest dependency
in their chromosomal neighborghood can be retrieved with:

<<>>=
findHighestGenes(model17qpSimCCA, 5)
@

We can also investigate the contribution of individual patients or
probes on the overall dependency (Fig.~\ref{fig:z}-~\ref{fig:W}). The
model parameters \(W\) and \(z\) are easily retrieved from the models
(see \cite{Lahti09mlsp} for description of the model parameters).  In
1-dimensional case their interpretation is straightforward; \(z\)
indicates the strength of shared signal in each sample (patient), and
\(W\) describes how the signal is captured by each probe. \(Wz\)
describes how the shared signal is manifested in each data set. With
multi-dimensional \(W\) and \(z\), the variable- and sample effects
are approximated (for visualization purposes) by the loadings and
projection scores corresponding of the first principal component of
\(Wz\).


\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
<<fig=true>>=
model <- findHighestModels(model17qpSimCCA, 1)[[1]]
plot(model, geneExp, geneCopyNum)
@
\end{center}
\caption{Samples and variable contribution to the dependencies around
  the gene with the highest dependency score between gene expression
  and copy number measurements in its chromosomal neighborghood. The
  visualization highlights affected patients and the associated
  genes.}
\label{fig:modelplot}
\end{figure}


\section{Implemented dependency models}

The package provides alternative probabilistic dependency
measures (set the 'method' variable in screen.chromosome). These
include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item probabilistic PCA (pPCA)
  \item probabilistic factor analysis (pFA)  
  \item probabilistic CCA (pCCA)
  \item probabilistic simCCA (pSimCCA)
\end{itemize}

These correspond to different assumptions regarding the structure of
the data set-specific covariances. The dimensionality of the shared
latent variable \(Z\) can also be set by the user. The SimCCA method
guides the dependency search with priors on \(W\).

For example, use probabilistic CCA with 1-dimensional \(Z\):

<<eval = FALSE>>=
model17qpCCA <- screen.chromosome(geneExp, geneCopyNum, windowSize = 10, chr = 17, arm = 'q', method = "pCCA", params = list("zDimension = 1"))
