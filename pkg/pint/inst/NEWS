CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.3 (2010-02-23)

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o calculate function name changed to screen.chromosome

NEW FEATURES

  o probabilistic factorial analysis model added
  o argument M in fit.dependency.model changed to H and arbitary matrix
  can be given instead of just identity matrix for pSimCCA method with T prior
  o plot.DependencyModel function added
  o z.projection and W.projection functions added.

HELP & Rd FILE CHANGES

  o changes to examples in help pages

DOCUMENTATION

  o Vignette updatet
  o Collate field added to DESCRIPTION

BUG FIXES

  o all methods of fit.dependency.model are fixed to give full W and phi 
  matrices with correct dimension names

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.4 (2010-03-08)

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o default method of screen.chromosome() changed to pSimCCA

NEW FEATURES

  o psimCCA method now accepts data matrices of a different size
  o used method in screen.chromosome() can be determined by parameters only
  o annotation types can be given to plot.DependencyModel() function
  o samples can be ordered in plot.DependencyModel() function according to their
  contribution to dependency model
  o dimension of latent variable z can be given with psimCCA method

BUG FIXES

  o bug fixed that prevented screening the whole genome 
  o show methods now print the used method when only parameters given to screen.chromosome()
  o incorrect gene name in DependencyModel objects corrected
